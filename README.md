# Demo-Application

A read-only React app over a hosted data platform (Enterprise, `https://<enterprise-host>`). The hosted server is the source of truth: the frontend sends it the query payloads in `frontend/src/queries/`, maps the responses into its own models and renders them. Nothing is stored.

Design notes: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

```text
Browser ──► frontend/ (React, :3000) ──/enterprise (Vite proxy adds the Bearer token)──► https://<enterprise-host>/api/v1/platform
```

`<enterprise-host>` stands for the Enterprise server's host name. It is set in `frontend/vite.config.ts` (proxy `target`) and is not repeated in the docs.

Endpoints used, relative to `https://<enterprise-host>/api/v1/platform`:

| Endpoint | Used by |
|---|---|
| `POST …/core/query-config-v2/execute?page=&size=` | Items, Parts and Sites lists, dashboard totals, hierarchy anchors |
| `GET …/core/data-configuration/table-configs/item-hierarchy` | Item Hierarchy configuration |
| `POST …/core/graph/match/execute` | Item Hierarchy tree, item Sources |
| `GET …/core/objects/partial/{id}` | Item and part Overview |

## What it does

| Tab | Shows | Enterprise calls |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboards** | Totals for top-level BOMs, Items, Parts and Sites, each linking to its tab | the list queries with `size=1`; the BOM tile runs only the hierarchy anchor query |
| **Item Hierarchy** | Products expanded into BOM child items (with qty) and the parts each item sources | table config → anchor query → one batched graph match |
| **Items** | Paged item table; an item number opens the item's details | query-config `item-query.json` |
| **Item details** | **Overview** (item properties in sections: risk bands and scores, sourcing, geography, compliance) and **Sources** (the item's sourced parts) | partial object; graph match `item-sources-graph.json` |
| **Parts** | Paged part table; a part number opens the part's details | query-config `part-query.json` |
| **Part details** | **Overview** (risk, lifecycle, sourcing, origin and trade, technical, qualifications, compliance) | partial object |
| **Sites** | Paged site table | query-config `site-query.json` |

All tables page on the server (`page` from 0, default 25 rows) and search within the page on screen.

## Configuration

Copy [frontend/.env.example](frontend/.env.example) to `frontend/.env` (git-ignored):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_ENTERPRISE_API_BASE_URL` | Path the browser calls; default `/enterprise` (the dev proxy) |
| `ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token for Enterprise. **Secret: only in `frontend/.env`, never in `.env.example` or Git.** Read only by the Vite dev proxy (Node side), so it never reaches the browser bundle |
| `ENTERPRISE_API_HOST` | Enterprise origin, `https://<enterprise-host>` (https, no path). Target of the Vite dev proxy (falls back to the built-in host when empty); also read by the Netlify Edge Function |

> **The hosted token expires after about 24 hours.** When it does, every tab shows "The Enterprise API token is missing or expired (401)". Put a fresh token in `frontend/.env` and restart `npm run dev`; Vite only reads `.env` at startup.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.3+.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

To build and serve the production bundle locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build      # writes dist/
npm run preview    # serves dist/ on http://localhost:4173 with the same /enterprise proxy
```

The token is injected by the Vite proxy (`npm run dev` and `npm run preview`). Hosting `dist/` anywhere else needs an equivalent reverse proxy: forward `/enterprise` to `https://<enterprise-host>/api/v1/platform` and add the `Authorization` header. Enterprise allows CORS from any origin, so the only reason for the proxy is keeping the token out of the browser.

## Deploy on Netlify

[netlify.toml](netlify.toml) sets up the build:
- It builds `frontend/` with Node 22 and publishes `frontend/dist`.
- It serves `index.html` for page routes such as `/parts` or `/items/123`.

`/enterprise/*` is handled by the Edge Function [frontend/netlify/edge-functions/enterprise.ts](frontend/netlify/edge-functions/enterprise.ts). It is the production counterpart of the Vite proxy:
- It forwards GET/POST requests, their query string and body, to `https://<enterprise-host>/api/v1/platform/*` on the configured host only.
- It adds the Bearer token server-side.
- It passes Enterprise's responses through unchanged.

1. In Netlify, go to **Site configuration → Environment variables** and add these with the default scopes:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `ENTERPRISE_API_HOST` | `https://<enterprise-host>`: origin only, https, no path |
   | `ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` | the Enterprise Bearer token (secret) |

2. **Redeploy** (Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site). The function only sees variable changes after a new deploy, so do this after every token renewal too.
3. Check with `POST https://<your-site>/enterprise/core/query-config-v2/execute?page=0&size=1` and a query body from `frontend/src/queries/`. It should return 200 with `results`.

Errors raised by the proxy itself have an `X-Enterprise-Proxy-Error` header, a `{ code, message }` body, and are shown as-is on the page:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROXY_NOT_CONFIGURED` | A variable is missing, or the site was not redeployed after adding it |
| `PROXY_INVALID_HOST` | `ENTERPRISE_API_HOST` is not an https URL |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | No response headers within 38 s |
| `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE` | Enterprise could not be reached |

Errors from Enterprise itself (for example 401 for an expired token) pass through without that header.

> The deployed site has no login: anyone with its URL sees the data through your token.

## Tests

```bash
cd frontend && npm run typecheck && npm test
```

Tests render each page against mocked Enterprise responses (MSW) shaped like the real ones.

## Notes

- **Item Hierarchy speed:** the graph match for a page of products is slow (about 30–40 s and 2 MB for 12 products), so its request timeout is 180 s.
- **Frontend toolchain:** pinned to Vite 6, Vitest 3 and jsdom 26, which still support Node 22.3. Newer majors need Node 22.12+.
